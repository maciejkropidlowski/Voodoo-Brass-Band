# README.md
The Landing Page Project I've created during my Odin Project journey.

In here I had to use html and css languages. 
I have decided to choose my own path and created a website that looked nothing like 
the template provided, but both websites share the same structure.
I chose my favorite brass band - Voodoo Brass Band as an inspiration.

This landing page still needs accessibility features.

Sources of images and pictures I have used on the website:

I hope that is everything.
